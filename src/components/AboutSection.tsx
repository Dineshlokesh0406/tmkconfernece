                As an abode of charity, Sree Siddaganga Math has been serving the society for more than a century with free education, food, and shelter to thousands of underprivileged rural children who have come from across the length and breadth of Karnataka and neighboring states, without any discrimination of caste and community. When His Holiness Sree Sree Sree Sivakumara Swamiji assumed the full responsibility of Sree Siddaganga Math in 1941, there were about 200 students. The ceaseless and untiring effort of Sree Sree Swamiji has resulted in the present magnitude of more than 10,000 children. Thousands of devotees are visiting Sree Math every day, who are provided free food. Sree Siddalinga Swamiji, the incumbent President of Sree Siddaganga Math has continued the services initiated and nurtured by his Guru.
